Concise AI is a modern web application designed to help users upload, summarize, and manage PDF documents using advanced AI models. The app provides a seamless experience for document summarization, storage, and retrieval, with a focus on usability and performance.

## Features

- **AI-Powered PDF Summarization**: Upload PDF files and receive concise, accurate summaries generated by state-of-the-art AI models (OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain).
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and sign-in flows using NextAuth.js for authentication.
- **Dashboard**: Personalized dashboard to view, download, and manage your summaries.
- **Summary Management**: View, download, and delete summaries. Source information and summary details are easily accessible.
- **Responsive UI**: Beautiful, modern, and mobile-friendly interface built with reusable UI components.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Server Actions, Prisma ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain (via custom library wrappers)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (managed via Prisma ORM)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **File Uploads**: UploadThing

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend

- Built with Next.js (App Router) and React for a fast, interactive user experience.
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and custom UI components for consistency.
- Features include a landing page, authentication pages, dashboard, upload form, and summary viewer.

### Backend

- API routes and server actions handle file uploads, summary generation, and user data management.
- Integrates with AI services (OpenAI, Gemini, LangChain) for generating summaries.
- Uses Prisma ORM for type-safe database access and migrations.
- Authentication is managed with NextAuth.js, supporting secure sessions.

### Database

- PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, managed via Prisma.
- Stores user data, uploaded files metadata, and generated summaries.

### Authentication

- NextAuth.js provides secure authentication flows (sign-in, sign-up, session management).
- Supports multiple providers if needed.

### File Uploads

- UploadThing is used for secure and efficient PDF uploads.
- Uploaded files are processed and summarized by the backend.

## How It Works

1. **User signs up or logs in.**
2. **Uploads a PDF document.**
3. **AI model generates a summary.**
4. **Summary is saved and displayed in the dashboard.**
5. **User can view, download, or delete summaries.**

## Development

- **Prisma** is used for database schema management and migrations.
- **Server Actions** and API routes handle backend logic.
- **Reusable UI components** for rapid development and consistent design.
